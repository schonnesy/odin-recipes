     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Baklava is a delicious Greek pastry dessert made up of layers of crispy phyllo dough, chopped nuts, and honey syrup that's so easy to make. A Greek friend showed me how to make this fabulous recipe.</p>
     
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Phyllo Dough</li>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey</li>
     </ul>

     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with melted butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</li>
        <li>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool before serving.</li>
     </ol>
